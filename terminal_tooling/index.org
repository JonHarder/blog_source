* Terminal tooling
  Over the years of working in software, I've sampled many, many command line and
  keyboard-centric tools. I have a fixation on finding tools that minimize the
  friction between my thoughts and the computer.
  
  In my journey this has lead me to terminal based workflows using terminal text
  editors, multiplexers, command line chat apps, note taking tools, and much more.
  
  In this weekly series of articles, I hope to publish deep dives into a variety of
  topics including file managers, core shell commands to help you master your system,
  innovative reimaginations of those classic commands, and novel tools which aim to
  bring more of your life into the terminal (like note taking, music players, chat
  clients, etc.)
