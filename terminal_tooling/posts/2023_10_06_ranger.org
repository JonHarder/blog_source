  [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][Ranger]] is a "console file manager with VI key bindings." Specifically
  it is a terminal file manager. You're most likely familiar with GUI
  file managers in the form of mac's finder, or the directrory viewer
  built into your editor of choice.

  Terminal file managers operate in a unique space as they tend to
  focus on keyboard based workflows over click-and-drag mouse-based
  workflows. How can you get anything done as a file manager using
  just your keyboard? If you're in the terminal, why not just use
  good ol' ~cd~, ~mv~, ~cp~, ~rm~ and friends?

  What you lose in intuitive (read: familiar) UI, you gain in
  expressive and configurable power.
