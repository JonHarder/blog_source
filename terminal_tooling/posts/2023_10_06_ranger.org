  [[https://ranger.github.io/][Ranger]] is a "console file manager with VI key bindings." Specifically it is a terminal
  file manager. You're most likely familiar with GUI file managers in the form of mac's
  finder, or the directrory viewer built into your editor of choice.

  Terminal file managers live in a unique space as they tend to focus on keyboard based
  workflows over click-and-drag mouse-based workflows. How can you get anything done as
  a file manager using just your keyboard? If you're in the terminal, why not just use
  good ol' cd, mv, cp, rm and friends?

  What you lose in intuitive (read: familiar) UI, you gain in expressive and configurable
  power.

  Convinced? Not yet? Let's see some examples

** Overview

  This is the initial view using ranger. You'll notice three vertical columns (and three
  highlighted files/directories). The center of the three is the working column, and it's on
  the selected entry in this column that your actions will operate (in this example, on the
  =kubernetes= directory).

  The left column is the parent directory, and the right directory displays either the contents
  of the current directory if a directory is highlighted, or a preview of the file if a file
  is highlighted.

  You might recognize this three-pane design pattern. If you've used the GUI file manager
  for macOS, Finder, this design has been a staple since their [[https://flaming.codes/posts/miller-columns-filesystem-ui][NeXT]] days.

** Navigation and file manipulation

*** Movement

  For a tool that touts "VI key bindings", no one should be surprised at the basic file
  and directory navigation keys: =h=, =j=, =k=, and =l=. =j= moves the selection in the center column one item
  down. =k= moves one item up. =l= will either move into the directory of the selection, or open the
  file of the selection by using your configured [[https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$EDITOR_variable][$EDITOR]].

  Moving around with h, j, k, and l allows you to fly around your file system, and the three-column
  view gives you a quick view of not only what's in the current directory, but also both what's in
  the parent directory and child directory.

  If this was all ranger could do, it would already be a fairly handy, albeit limited use tool
  (it also wouldn't really be a full 'file manager' in that case either). Ranger handles much
  more however.

*** Deleting, Copying, Moving, etc.
