Over the years of working in software, I've sampled many, many command line and
keyboard-centric tools. I have a fixation on finding tools that minimize the
friction between my thoughts and the computer.

On my journey this has lead me to terminal based workflows using terminal text
editors, multiplexers, command line chat apps, note taking tools, and much more.

In this weekly series of articles, I hope to publish deep dives into a variety of
topics including file managers, core shell commands to help you master your system,
innovative re-imaginations of those classic commands, and novel tools which aim to
bring more of your life into the terminal (like note taking, music players, chat
clients, etc.)

To kick off the inaugural article, I will be taking a look at the terminal file
manager, [[file:posts/2023_10_06_ranger.org][ranger]].  This will be the first of 4 articles focusing on terminal
file managers (October is national terminal file manager month...I just decided).
