* jonharder.github.io blog source

  This repository tracks the source for my blog hosted at
  [[https://jonharder.github.io]].

  The HTML that ultimately gets hosted is generated using emacs with
  [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org-publish]]. The project is configured in my emacs configuration [[https://github.com/JonHarder/emacs_config/blob/main/config.org#org-publish][here]].
